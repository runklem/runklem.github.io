		<h5>Day 1</h5>
		<p>5:36pm, Day 1; feels like the end of the day. A few familiar things, but mostly not.<br><br>Worked with some basic code modifications and running an application on Twitter.<br>The process is mostly a fog, but I think that's partly because of its relative simplicity.<br>At least to the extent that we didn't write any code just made a few modifications,<br>and set up a lot of accounts to make the thing run.<br><br>Second lab was Git based. A little confusing in that there are multiple ways of doing<br>the same thing that seem instinctively to be unrelated. Apparently, there are also<br>different versions of essentially the same thing and some work while others don't<br>- i.e. an incorrect command prompt based on the lack (or maybe presence) of a security<br>certificate (or some such thing). A big part of the challenge of learning to code<br>seems to be understanding not simply the interconnectedness of the various components,<br>but also the multitude of ways the same task can be accomplished and choosing the best approach<br>for a given task.<br><br>Spent forever trying to add a simple text file to a GitHub repository with SourceTree. Ultimately,<br>the solution was simply to create a text file, and save it in the same directory as<br>the repository.<br><br>By 8pm the very basics of SourceTree are making sense.<br><br>Tired; satisfied.</p>

		<h5>Day 2</h5>
		<p>Second day. Overall more interesting, and more comfortable.<br>Less setting up of accounts, and more code writing. It's always<br>a fog trying to remember exactly what we've done. Spent a lot<br>of time playing with iPython Notebooks; tinkering with formatting<br>and output. First AOYO lab covered computing string length, adding<br>a string to a variable input for a combined print statement, returning<br>a specific term within a list, and stripping the first and last<br>terms from a list print list[1:-1].<br><br>Second lab dealt with condition execution: if, elif, else. Covered<br>comparison operators. TURN OFF TABS. Learned the importance of<br>indentation (nested decisions), capitalization. Covered one, two,<br>and multi-way decisions. Labs ranged from intuitive and satisfying<br>(if/else squirrel play given season) to extremely frustrating, and where<br>I'm still stuck evaluating a numbers relationship to a multiple of 10.<br>I have an idea that seems to be getting upended by rounding issues.<br>Probably need to use modulo. Very little experience with this as<br>an actual mathematical tool.<br><br>Need to dig a little more deeply into some of these less familiar concepts.</p>

		<h5>Day 3</h5>
		<p>Day 3, June 3, 2015<br><br>Partly a carry over from yesterday, but finished cleaning up<br>code late last night to determine whether or not a number is<br>equal to or with two digits of a multiple of ten. This required<br>the realization that the remainder (modulo) isn't simply a concept<br>for the fourth grade. Initially, I had divided my number input by<br>10 and realized the decimal place of the target numbers was always<br>.8, .9, 0, .1, or .2. Had code written relatively quickly to use<br>this pattern, but a rounded area somewhere within the machine prevented<br>it from working properly. Eventually, decided to make friends with<br>modulo, and the solution was relatively simple. The same pattern<br>remained the answer, but without the decimal points - i.e. 8, 9, 0, 1,<br>2. Ryan had worked on the decimal solution overnight, and found<br>"import decimal from Decimal" to be useful, though, it wasn't entirely<br>clear whether or not lingering issues remained.<br><br>Pared down script from late last night to validate the format of an email<br>address. I had a very bulky solution last night, and one that didn't<br>catch all errors. Used .split("@") to separate mailbox from domain portions,<br>and len(emailSplit) to evaluate portions of the address in addition to<br>checking for the presence of "@", ensuring there were 2 list items in the<br>split, and checking for specific characters. The bulkiness of last night primarily<br>came from the method by which I was trying to exclude numbers from the first characters<br>position in the mailbox portion of the address. Ultimately, .isalpha() saved the day.<br><br>This morning's lecture covered functions. I understand the concept pretty well,<br>but their implication is trickier than it would seem. We started writing code<br>for a relatively tricky dice game that we invented. I feel like I need loops<br>to pare down this code. I have functions in place, but their guts still seem very<br>bulky. My approach to labs so far has been to get the inputs working as a set<br>up to easy access to the data later.</p>

		<h5>Day 4</h5>
		<p>Day 4, June 4, 2015<br>Spent all day with dice game; miles from being finished.<br>Was flying this morning, but flying with longhand code writing.<br>Inevitably, I hit a point where I couldn't continue. I'm now<br>struggling like crazy to think in functions and loops rather<br>than longhand logic.</p>

		<h5>Day 5</h5>
		<p>Day 5: June 5, 2015<br><br>A lot of progress today. Moving into late yesterday afternoon I<br>was struggling to see anything in terms of functions and loops.<br>Started understanding it before leaving yesterday, and actually<br>woke up at 1:30am with an idea about how to substantially shrink<br>my dice rolling function. Initially, I had established a separate<br>random number generator for each of the six die. While sleeping I<br>came up with:<br><br>from random import randit<br><br>def dieRoll(dieSelection):<br>roll=randit(1,dieSelection)<br>return roll<br><br>Spent all of today re-writing the dice program in functions and<br>loops that operate with a Player class object. Still using a little<br>longhand thinking in that I am taking player name input in one<br>function, then converting it to an object in another:<br><br>#get player names<br>def getNames(i):<br>playersList=[]<br>while len(playersList)<i:<br>input = raw_input("Player enter your name >")<br>playersList.append(input)<br>return playersList<br><br>use playersList to create objects<br>def convertToObjects(pL):<br>playerObjects=[]<br>for i in pL:<br>player = Player(i)<br>playerObjects.append(player)<br>return playerObjects<br><br>Also, taking in number of players separately:<br><br>#get number of players<br>def numPlayers():<br> input = raw_input("Enter number of players >")<br>input = int(input)<br>return input<br><br>Eventhough, all of these things could be done separately there is, for<br>now anyway, use for me in thinking about every aspect of the program<br>separately, and writing them as individual functions.</p>
