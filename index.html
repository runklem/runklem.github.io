         <h3>Welcome,</h3> 
         <p>Following a varied educational background, and after years in the real estate industry I'm now studying software development at <a href="http://www.devcodecamp.com/" target="_blank">devCodeCamp</a>. I've found coding to be a wholly unique challenge that pushes one's way of thinking while fostering a rare blend of creativity and technical understanding.</p>

         <h4 class="shadow center">Painting</h4>
         <p>Most of my time in college was spent as an art student, but I left academic art after three years. Early non-representational painting began influencing my thinking, and I started winning some recognition in group exhibitions as a watercolorist. After having my first solo exhibit I retired myself indefinitely while I studied a number of things I thought were necessary to progress my work. Along the way early twentieth century American scene paitning became a strong influence, and I began combining what I think of as the vocabulary of modern non-representational painting with the subject matter of the American scene painters. This work began earning some recognition eventually leading to representation at two galleries, and publication in the national magazine Professional Artist. My paintings can be viewed at <a href="http://www.matthewrunkle.com/" target="_blank">MatthewRunkle.com</a>.</p>

         <h4 class="shadow center">Printmaking</h4>
         <p>Never inclined to be content the creative urge has moved my artistic interests from painting to printmaking. As scene painting began influencing my earlier work photography, particularly urban imagery, became very important to my thinking, and lead to a substantial interest in early fine art photography. The printing techniques of these photographers were things I wanted to use in my own work, but had no interest in the heavy use of chemicals. Fortunately, there are modern products that allow similar techniques without the chemicals. The discovery of these products raised an important question that has lead to a much longer journey than I expected: How to create the image that is transfered to the plate for printing? Enter "Interest No. 3".</p>

      <div id="threeD" class="col-sm-4">
         <h4 class="shadow center">3D Modeling/Computer Graphics</h4>
         <p>Following from the conundrum of Interest No. 2 I began exploring digital means to create images to transfer to a plate for printing. After exploring Photoshop as an illustration tool I found 3D graphics to be the perfect answer. It was the first medium that struck me as the ideal way to combine my influences in painting with those in photography, and considering the substantial range of possibilities an artist can build an image that falls anywhere from absolute photo-realism to two-dimensional illustration. Ultimately, I see the path from printmaking to 3D leading back to painting as a way to add coloring and multi-media depth to the finished work.</p>
