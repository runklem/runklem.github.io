		<h5>Day 17</h5>
		<p>Day 17, June 23, 2015<br>I'm definitely happy to be working with Javascript. It's more familiar to me than Python, but in particular I'm much happier with the Javascript loop syntax. Being able to establish (with a for loop) an iteration variable, while statement (of a sort), and increment value within the establishment of the loop is far more intuitive to me than needing to iterate through a list with something like for & each.<br><br>The day was primarily consumed with lab work. Most of it was relatively easy, but I got hung up for a while trying to calculate the months, days, minutes, and seconds between two dates. Ultimately, I managed relatively concise working code, though, it doesn't take into account the varied lengths of the different months. I found a way to handle this, but it was quite complex, and would take more time to study than fits the context of basic lab work which did not require the conisderation of variation in the length of the months. I'll revisit it as needed in the future.<br><br>Near the end of the day we had a unique group coding challenge where we paired up and tried to write code that could not be deciphered by another group. Marc and I tried to double a given variable while disguising this operation. We ultimately succeeded by making a messy function named kevin that output the number 2 by absurd means. We then stored the output of kevin into a variable lll that we fed into a second function called pete which multiplied our variable by kevin. Entertaining to say the least!</p>

		<h5>Day 16</h5>
		<p>Day 16, June 22, 2015<br>Familiar territory today. As a precursor to Javascript we spent the day with HTML and CSS. Coming into class CSS is what I had used more than anything else. This familiarity lead to frustration mostly. First, because it wasn't anything new. Second, because it's been six months since I've actually used it which means I have a recollection of all the great features available, but no real memory of how to implement most of them. Nevertheless, I managed a respectable reworking of my new website homepage. I focused primarily on adding background colors to the top and bottom blocks of text while also using the border-radius property to clip the corners of these backgrounds. I also added box and text shadows to add a bit of depth to the appearance. We ended the day with our introduction to Javascript via two lectures and one short coding challenge where we simply displayed Hello World in an alert dialog box. We've been given permission to leave early today. I'll probably take advantage of that, but will likely preview our new labs first. Looking forward to the challenge of Javascript, although, I've actually spent almost as much time with Javascript as CSS. I say challenge, though, because I'm sure we'll be using it in ways that will stretch my ability to think about problems in the most efficient way.</p>

		<h5>Day 15</h5>
		<p>Day 15, June 19, 2015<br>Wrapped up the asteroids game today. Mike added an id tag to the explosion class so I could differentiate between asteroid and ship explosions. The ship is now the only element with the dramatic explosion. Also, needed to finish the power up graphics assets; added the power up icon, a laser wave bullet upgrade, and bubble shield. At the end of the day I had a little time to add the hunting game easter egg I had wanted. The easter egg works by - within a set score range - changing the ship into a man with a hand gun, the star field into a grassy field, and the asteroids into cattle (wanted to make it more of a safari-type hunt, but I couldn't find good sprite assets for that). We also took a field trip to PK Ware. It was interesting to see a working operation and ask a few questions. I ended the day by volunteering to go first for our python final exam. It took about an hour. I struggled with a few particulars especially a proof problem. Ben mentioned he's actually taking it out of the exam because it's too hard. Suppose there's nothing wrong with having struggled then.<br><br>Feeling exhausted, but very satisfied. We made a great product with our asteroids game, and I made gigantic progress this week with my understand of data structure and interactivity.</p>

		<h5>Day 14</h5>
		<p>Day 14, June 18, 2015<br>Long day, but a lot of success progressing our asteroids game. We have a full game style format including score, lives, game over screen, and high scores. I had a lot of code work getting the last bits in: checking lives, updating score, switching graphics on collisions, printing game over screen, and high scores. Also, included ship graphics for invicibility on respawn and a thrust flame. Spent a while trying to add a ship explosion graphic, but I've realized that I need some way to identifiy the type of explosion - i.e. ship or asteroid<br><br>... actually, jumped back into the code, and added the ship explosion outside of the if statement in which the the ship Explosion group object is created. This doesn't function the way I intednded, but it's actually a nice effect. My intention was to create a ship explosion more dramatic than the asteroid explosion, so I tripled the size of the graphics. The problem I'm having is that I either don't have a way, or I don't know the way to check whether or not the explosion was tied to a ship or an asteroid, so every time the game loops through the smaller asteroid explosion overwrites the larger ship explosion. For the time being I've simply set both explosion sequences in the outer loop of the display screen function with the larger explosion second. The result is that everytime anything blows up there's a flip between large and small graphics. As I mentioned it's a nice dramatic effect, but I need to figure out how to do what I originally intended, compare the two, and decide which to keep.</p>

		<h5>Day 13</h5>
		<p>Day 13, June 17, 2015<br>A rough start to the day that we completely turned around into a great ending. The morning was almost enitrely consumed by source control issues. The git command line process we were using turned into a nightmare of out of sync updates. After getting things under control we started using a more streamlined process using Source Tree and pushing directly into the common repository. Once we managed to get the morning behind us we made great progress with our asteroids game. By the end of the day we could fly the ship, shoot, a laser, and have the asteroids disappear on collision with the laser. My work started with getting all graphics functions into my code as the splash screen was still in the engine file. A simple process, but I did add two functions to make coding the estalishment of the screen a little less redundant. As the day progressed Mike changed what had been class objects into Sprite groups which necessitated different handling in the graphics functions. I also added a function to detect collisions based on work that had been completed with the asteroid class. We have a few lag issues that we realized are a product of debug prints. Ultimately, we'll remove the debug prints, and alter speed variables as needed. Tomorrow my goals are establishing a scoreboard, lives counter, invicibility on respawn to avoid being immediately smashed by an asteroid, establishing collision detection between ship and asteroid, adding an explosion graphic, and creating an image for ship thrust. As a team our goal is to have a working game structure - i.e. a beginning and end with a score, life counter, and more asteroids.</p>

		<h5>Day 12</h5>
		<p>Day 12, June 16, 2015<br>Watched 10 tutroials in a pyGame series last night and this morning. The videos were simple and well put together, and really helped me to understand how what I had just started learning about data structure fits into pyGames. I spent today working on gathering graphics and writing the functions to implement the graphics display in our Asteroids game. Everything fell into place pretty nicely, and it didn't take too much time working with Mike to make my functions integrate with the main game engine. I spent more time than I had wanted cleaning up some of the graphics, and I'm still not happy with all of them, but I'm also trying to avoid getting too bogged down with things that aren't overly important right now. The graphics can be made cleaner later. I'm really trying to stay focused on learning the code.<br><br>Tomorrow, my goal is to pull the start up screen functionality into the grahpics function as it's still in the main engine. Our goal as a group for tomorrow is to get a clean playable first iteration that goes beyond the basic fly and gather asteroids functionaility of today's build. Shouldn't be too hard as we've made significant progress thus far. I'm going to spend a little time studying the other's code as I still don't understand all of the functionality they've built in, and the what and why of that functionaility. All totaled it's been a good day making progress toward understanding.</p>

		<h5>Day 11</h5>
		<p>Day 11, June 15, 2015<br>Came in to the day feeling a good sense of success from last week. Then, of course - as Monday goes - a new assignment with a problem that I'm not even sure how to think about. I assume this week will be something like last: struggle like hell for three days, finally start to grasp things, then begin to feel comfortable just in time for next week to start, and begin the whole process again.<br><br>pyGames is the new problem for this week. A graphics application that we're using to build an Asteroids clone. I'm handling the graphics assets, and will need to build the library and handle displaying the objects. I've found a series of video tutorials that should help me understand the basics. Unfortunately, most documentation is difficult to find anything meaningful in, and many code examples are only substantially useful if what you need to do is very much like what the code is pre-designed to do. The broader concepts, and how to manipulate the various functions - and what the functions are in the first place - often remain difficult to find and understand. I've said it before, and nothing has changed: learning to code is a substantially difficult exercise in learning not simply how to code, but - in the first place - how to think. I have no doubt that I'll figure this process out, but it is certainly the most difficult thing I've done.<br><br>My goal for tomorrow is to take what I learn from tutorials tonight, and understand to display and change objects on the screen. Ultimately, I don't think my code will be responsible for moving the objects, but I need to know how to do it so I can better see the interactions that will be necessary for my contributions.</p>

		<h5>Day 10</h5>
		<p>Day 10, June 12, 2015<br>Started with quite a bit of work to finish. Eventhough, happy numbers was out of the way I still had two labs to finish. Spent forever writing the spelling-numbers-in-words task. I began that project with the idea to convert a number to a string, split it into groups of 3, then evaluate those groups and length of the total list. The problem was that breaking the number into list groups left any odd number attached to the right side of the list rather than the left. I was able to invert the number, then group, and flip it back. This worked, and I thougt I had things figured out until I realized any numbers ending in zero resulted in the stripping of the zeros during the flipping process. Ultimately, I managed working code. It was bulky, but on the up side it was bulky because of all the functions I used. A significant improvement from fumbling around with functions just a week ago.<br><br>Completed our second white board challenge which invloved creating two class objects: Ant and Colony. I was rolling through it until I hit the final requirement which was to establish that a worker and a queen could reproduce. Initially, viewed this as a method of the colony because I saw it as a function of population, but ultimately once I had written the function I could see it fit as belonging to the ant class since the process creates a new ant before it creates a population increase.<br><br>Ended the day with an assignment to create or own version of the game Lemonade Stand. I have my class objects created and the intial game spin-up. Hope to make some progress over the weekend if I can squeeze it in between appraisal work and remodeling decisions.</p>

		<h5>Day 9</h5>
		<p>Day 9, June 11, 2015<br>Happy Numbers is finished! My problem about how to keep evaluating numbers was solved when I realized I could iterate through a list of numbers to evaluate, and simply feed the iteration into my mainFunction as the primary input. It contiues to amaze me how simple some of these solutions are once you've realized how to think about them.<br><br>At the lab late again last night working on the GUI for my color analysis tool. Finished this morning with a respectable functional first iteration. The interface includes a five swatch color scheme across the top, a large central color swatch in the middle, and the RGB information of each of the scheme colors. The color scheme swatches change on an Enter press when new numbers are entered in their respective fields. The large swatch then averages all RGB values, displays the equivalent color, and prints its RGB values.<br><br>Need to make a lot of progress on labs now. A little behind because of how long it took to get through happy numbers. Also, need sleep tonight. Will have to find a balance.</p>

		<h5>Day 8</h5>
		<p>Day 8, June 10, 2015<br>Solved a major problem with the happy numbers problem. I couldn't get the function to continually evaluate a new input after the first iteration through the squaring, summing, and eval process. I spent hours yesterday trying to figure out how to take new input, and place it back into the function call to get it to re-run the analysis with the new number. I was fixated almost literally on the spatial problem of how to move my new input from the bottom of the mainFunction back to the top where it was called. In the end the simple answer was move the function down - i.e. recall the function with the new input immediately after the new input was established. This example is a good expression of one part of my primary challenge to see not just the underlying data structure of the problem, but also the interconnectedness/interactivity of the parts which go on top - i.e. the classes, functions, loops, etc. It's occurred to me that the two are very closely related. It's difficult (and maybe not fully possible) to see the entirety of the underlying structure without also being practically aware of how the pieces will interact. Not that it's necessary to know what all of the pieces are, but a solid understanding of how they work seems essential to understanding structure because the nature of those interactions will ultimately necessitate certain key features of the structure.<br><br>Also, laid out substantially the primary ideas behind my color analysis tool. Working on the advice to begin with the highest risk element of the project - i.e. the thing that I have no experience with. In this case it's a GUI. Mostly finished with a tutorial, and will be finished before the day is over. From there the main task will be to modify the example code in the tutorial to match my specific needs.<br><br>Also, need to get a lab or two complete before I get too far behind there. I've definitely taken a lot in over the last couple of days, but I still have some brain synapses that need to work out their rewiring. It seems there are aspects of coding that literally require changes in fundamental thinking.</p>

		<h5>Day 7</h5>
		<p>Day 7, June 9, 2015<br>Worked primarily on happy numbers today. A little on our game too, but was struggling a bit. Wrote a function to reply play again or declare game over. It's occurred to me that code is often more readable backwards. Even the problem solving process seems to work better in reverse - i.e. coding a function to process the ultimate solution, then a function for the process before, etc. Having realized that learning to see structure is my primary need should help me focus on how to better approach things moving forward. The analogy of a tree strikes me as particularly relevant where the tree and branches are the underlying data structure, and the fruit that would hang on the tree is the various bits of code. I can live without knowing what all of the fruit is or where it goes, but I have to learn to see the tree.</p>

		<h5>Day 6</h5>
		<p>Day 6, June 8, 2015<br>Starting to think I've over shot with my attempt to simplify my code writing. I've essentially banished all if/elif/else statements in exchange for functions and loops that I can't entirely figure out how to use. The logic is clear enough, and I'm getting the hang of scope and syntax, but I think ultimately the shorthand is unnecessarily short. It's left me stuck trying to do too many things that at this point are not intuitive at the expense of those things that are intuitive. Importantly, the intuitive things are usable which leaves the entire exercise creating more problems than not. It's obvious I need to find a balance</p>

		<h5>Day 5</h5>
		<p>Day 5: June 5, 2015<br><br>A lot of progress today. Moving into late yesterday afternoon I<br>was struggling to see anything in terms of functions and loops.<br>Started understanding it before leaving yesterday, and actually<br>woke up at 1:30am with an idea about how to substantially shrink<br>my dice rolling function. Initially, I had established a separate<br>random number generator for each of the six die. While sleeping I<br>came up with:<br><br>from random import randit<br><br>def dieRoll(dieSelection):<br>roll=randit(1,dieSelection)<br>return roll<br><br>Spent all of today re-writing the dice program in functions and<br>loops that operate with a Player class object. Still using a little<br>longhand thinking in that I am taking player name input in one<br>function, then converting it to an object in another:<br><br>#get player names<br>def getNames(i):<br>playersList=[]<br>while len(playersList)<i:<br>input = raw_input("Player enter your name >")<br>playersList.append(input)<br>return playersList<br><br>use playersList to create objects<br>def convertToObjects(pL):<br>playerObjects=[]<br>for i in pL:<br>player = Player(i)<br>playerObjects.append(player)<br>return playerObjects<br><br>Also, taking in number of players separately:<br><br>#get number of players<br>def numPlayers():<br> input = raw_input("Enter number of players >")<br>input = int(input)<br>return input<br><br>Eventhough, all of these things could be done separately there is, for<br>now anyway, use for me in thinking about every aspect of the program<br>separately, and writing them as individual functions.</p>

		<h5>Day 4</h5>
		<p>Day 4, June 4, 2015<br>Spent all day with dice game; miles from being finished.<br>Was flying this morning, but flying with longhand code writing.<br>Inevitably, I hit a point where I couldn't continue.

		<h5>Day 3</h5>
		<p>Day 3, June 3, 2015<br><br>Partly a carry over from yesterday, but finished cleaning up<br>code late last night to determine whether or not a number is<br>equal to or with two digits of a multiple of ten. This required<br>the realization that the remainder (modulo) isn't simply a concept<br>for the fourth grade. Initially, I had divided my number input by<br>10 and realized the decimal place of the target numbers was always<br>.8, .9, 0, .1, or .2. Had code written relatively quickly to use<br>this pattern, but a rounded area somewhere within the machine prevented<br>it from working properly. Eventually, decided to make friends with<br>modulo, and the solution was relatively simple. The same pattern<br>remained the answer, but without the decimal points - i.e. 8, 9, 0, 1,<br>2. Ryan had worked on the decimal solution overnight, and found<br>"import decimal from Decimal" to be useful, though, it wasn't entirely<br>clear whether or not lingering issues remained.<br><br>Pared down script from late last night to validate the format of an email<br>address. I had a very bulky solution last night, and one that didn't<br>catch all errors. Used .split("@") to separate mailbox from domain portions,<br>and len(emailSplit) to evaluate portions of the address in addition to<br>checking for the presence of "@", ensuring there were 2 list items in the<br>split, and checking for specific characters. The bulkiness of last night primarily<br>came from the method by which I was trying to exclude numbers from the first characters<br>position in the mailbox portion of the address. Ultimately, .isalpha() saved the day.<br><br>This morning's lecture covered functions. I understand the concept pretty well,<br>but their implication is trickier than it would seem. We started writing code<br>for a relatively tricky dice game that we invented. I feel like I need loops<br>to pare down this code. I have functions in place, but their guts still seem very<br>bulky. My approach to labs so far has been to get the inputs working as a set<br>up to easy access to the data later.</p>

		<h5>Day 2</h5>
		<p>Second day. Overall more interesting, and more comfortable.<br>Less setting up of accounts, and more code writing. It's always<br>a fog trying to remember exactly what we've done. Spent a lot<br>of time playing with iPython Notebooks; tinkering with formatting<br>and output. First AOYO lab covered computing string length, adding<br>a string to a variable input for a combined print statement, returning<br>a specific term within a list, and stripping the first and last<br>terms from a list print list[1:-1].<br><br>Second lab dealt with condition execution: if, elif, else. Covered<br>comparison operators. TURN OFF TABS. Learned the importance of<br>indentation (nested decisions), capitalization. Covered one, two,<br>and multi-way decisions. Labs ranged from intuitive and satisfying<br>(if/else squirrel play given season) to extremely frustrating, and where<br>I'm still stuck evaluating a numbers relationship to a multiple of 10.<br>I have an idea that seems to be getting upended by rounding issues.<br>Probably need to use modulo. Very little experience with this as<br>an actual mathematical tool.<br><br>Need to dig a little more deeply into some of these less familiar concepts.</p>

		<h5>Day 1</h5>
		<p>5:36pm, Day 1; feels like the end of the day. A few familiar things, but mostly not.<br><br>Worked with some basic code modifications and running an application on Twitter.<br>The process is mostly a fog, but I think that's partly because of its relative simplicity.<br>At least to the extent that we didn't write any code just made a few modifications,<br>and set up a lot of accounts to make the thing run.<br><br>Second lab was Git based. A little confusing in that there are multiple ways of doing<br>the same thing that seem instinctively to be unrelated. Apparently, there are also<br>different versions of essentially the same thing and some work while others don't<br>- i.e. an incorrect command prompt based on the lack (or maybe presence) of a security<br>certificate (or some such thing). A big part of the challenge of learning to code<br>seems to be understanding not simply the interconnectedness of the various components,<br>but also the multitude of ways the same task can be accomplished and choosing the best approach<br>for a given task.<br><br>Spent forever trying to add a simple text file to a GitHub repository with SourceTree. Ultimately,<br>the solution was simply to create a text file, and save it in the same directory as<br>the repository.<br><br>By 8pm the very basics of SourceTree are making sense.<br><br>Tired; satisfied.</p>
