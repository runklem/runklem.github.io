The load feature now displays a list of surveys by title that are in the database, and gives the user the option to choose which one to load. Ryan and I spent most of the morning and early afternoon working the two sides of this loading functionality where he was trying to incorporate his constructor templates with the menu selectors, and I was trying to read the data to display the actual database entries in an accessible format. My next task is to read the inputs from the survey taker page, and form the JSON file for shipment to the database. Spent most of my afternoon studying the data structure, and figuring out how to actually access and modify it. This was no small task for me as this is what I struggle with most: the literal syntax of accessing data structure. Monday morning we should be able to put the finishing touches on it, and have a working MVP before moving on to C# on Tuesday."

		"text":"Full time now on the survey project. Started the day with a few layout issues on my webpage. I was able to clean up the html and css which better organized the code and solved the problem. As Ryan and I began integrating what we had both been working on I realized there was still a formatting issue related to building the sidebar. As the sidebar grew it continually pushed the question blocks down. The solution wasn't obvious, so I had to dive back into the details of the code, and undo a lot of what I had in place. Ultimately, I relaized the main problem was in the relationship between sidebar and question block parent elements. Fixing the position of the sidebar also caused a change in the size of its parent element which necessiated a few unexpected changes in the css sizing. Ending the day by wrapping up a few user interface items like changing the title by clicking, and populating the sidebar with the new value. Tomorrow I'm going to focus on creating the page for the individuals who are taking the survey, continue integration with Ryan's functions, and work on tweeking UI elements as time permits."

From there I started the writing of a few basic survey build functions for our group project which was intended to help understand the way in which our data file is accessed. I hadn't spent much time on this when I realized it all seemed like wasted effort without an actual page to display the results, so I dove back in to a number of html and css tutorials I had done in the past to remind myself how to structure and style content in a usable way. This task accounted for most of the rest of my day, and we now have a respectable looking web page to display our functionality. Tomorrow I'll be writing the jquery event listeners that will trigger the build functions. Ryan and I will be working closely to incorporate this complete set of functionality. For the time being I'll have to set a few of the buttons to dumby page loads, so we have a placeholder that will ultimately be replaced by saving and loading functionaility."

Last night I was struggling to clear the old posts on a new page selection, then I realized I had a few things out of order, and once the code was straigthened up I was able to use .empty() to clear the old posts without wiping out things I wanted to keep. After finishing pagination I moved on to the search function. I found a good example of sample code, but need to figure out how to incorporate the functionality into my own site. I was just starting to get into this when we got a new assignment: create a building cost calculator for a theoretical cube house. I really felt good about this one.

Most of it was relatively easy, but I got hung up for a while trying to calculate the months, days, minutes, and seconds between two dates. Ultimately, I managed relatively concise working code, though, it doesn't take into account the varied lengths of the different months. I found a way to handle this, but it was quite complex, and would take more time to study than fits the context of basic lab work which did not require the conisderation of variation in the length of the months. I'll revisit it as needed in the future.<br><br>Near the end of the day we had a unique group coding challenge where we paired up and tried to write code that could not be deciphered by another group. Marc and I tried to double a given variable while disguising this operation. We ultimately succeeded by making a messy function named kevin that output the number 2 by absurd means.

		"text":"Familiar territory today. As a precursor to Javascript we spent the day with HTML and CSS. Coming into class CSS is what I had used more than anything else. This familiarity lead to frustration mostly. First, because it wasn't anything new. Second, because it's been six months since I've actually used it which means I have a recollection of all the great features available, but no real memory of how to implement most of them. Nevertheless, I managed a respectable reworking of my new website homepage. I focused primarily on adding background colors to the top and bottom blocks of text while also using the border-radius property to clip the corners of these backgrounds. I also added box and text shadows to add a bit of depth to the appearance. We ended the day with our introduction to Javascript via two lectures and one short coding challenge where we simply displayed Hello World in an alert dialog box. We've been given permission to leave early today. I'll probably take advantage of that, but will likely preview our new labs first. Looking forward to the challenge of Javascript, although, I've actually spent almost as much time with Javascript as CSS. I say challenge, though, because I'm sure we'll be using it in ways that will stretch my ability to think about problems in the most efficient way."

The ship is now the only element with the dramatic explosion. Also, needed to finish the power up graphics assets; added the power up icon, a laser wave bullet upgrade, and bubble shield. At the end of the day I had a little time to add the hunting game easter egg I had wanted. The easter egg works by - within a set score range - changing the ship into a man with a hand gun, the star field into a grassy field, and the asteroids into cattle (wanted to make it more of a safari-type hunt, but I couldn't find good sprite assets for that). We also took a field trip to PK Ware. It was interesting to see a working operation and ask a few questions. I ended the day by volunteering to go first for our python final exam. It took about an hour. I struggled with a few particulars especially a proof problem. Ben mentioned he's actually taking it out of the exam because it's too hard. Suppose there's nothing wrong with having struggled then.<br><br>Feeling exhausted, but very satisfied.

I had a lot of code work getting the last bits in: checking lives, updating score, switching graphics on collisions, printing game over screen, and high scores. Also, included ship graphics for invicibility on respawn and a thrust flame. Spent a while trying to add a ship explosion graphic, but I've realized that I need some way to identifiy the type of explosion - i.e. ship or asteroid<br><br>... actually, jumped back into the code, and added the ship explosion outside of the if statement in which the the ship Explosion group object is created. This doesn't function the way I intednded, but it's actually a nice effect. My intention was to create a ship explosion more dramatic than the asteroid explosion, so I tripled the size of the graphics. The problem I'm having is that I either don't have a way, or I don't know the way to check whether or not the explosion was tied to a ship or an asteroid, so every time the game loops through the smaller asteroid explosion overwrites the larger ship explosion. For the time being I've simply set both explosion sequences in the outer loop of the display screen function with the larger explosion second. The result is that everytime anything blows up there's a flip between large and small graphics. As I mentioned it's a nice dramatic effect, but I need to figure out how to do what I originally intended, compare the two, and decide which to keep."

		"text":"A rough start to the day that we completely turned around into a great ending. The morning was almost enitrely consumed by source control issues. The git command line process we were using turned into a nightmare of out of sync updates. After getting things under control we started using a more streamlined process using Source Tree and pushing directly into the common repository. Once we managed to get the morning behind us we made great progress with our asteroids game. By the end of the day we could fly the ship, shoot, a laser, and have the asteroids disappear on collision with the laser. My work started with getting all graphics functions into my code as the splash screen was still in the engine file. A simple process, but I did add two functions to make coding the estalishment of the screen a little less redundant. As the day progressed Mike changed what had been class objects into Sprite groups which necessitated different handling in the graphics functions. I also added a function to detect collisions based on work that had been completed with the asteroid class. We have a few lag issues that we realized are a product of debug prints. Ultimately, we'll remove the debug prints, and alter speed variables as needed. Tomorrow my goals are establishing a scoreboard, lives counter, invicibility on respawn to avoid being immediately smashed by an asteroid, establishing collision detection between ship and asteroid, adding an explosion graphic, and creating an image for ship thrust. As a team our goal is to have a working game structure - i.e. a beginning and end with a score, life counter, and more asteroids."

The videos were simple and well put together, and really helped me to understand how what I had just started learning about data structure fits into pyGames. I spent today working on gathering graphics and writing the functions to implement the graphics display in our Asteroids game. Everything fell into place pretty nicely, and it didn't take too much time working with Mike to make my functions integrate with the main game engine. I spent more time than I had wanted cleaning up some of the graphics, and I'm still not happy with all of them, but I'm also trying to avoid getting too bogged down with things that aren't overly important right now. The graphics can be made cleaner later. I'm really trying to stay focused on learning the code.<br><br>Tomorrow, my goal is to pull the start up screen functionality into the grahpics function as it's still in the main engine. Our goal as a group for tomorrow is to get a clean playable first iteration that goes beyond the basic fly and gather asteroids functionaility of today's build. Shouldn't be too hard as we've made significant progress thus far. I'm going to spend a little time studying the other's code as I still don't understand all of the functionality they've built in, and the what and why of that functionaility.

A graphics application that we're using to build an Asteroids clone. I'm handling the graphics assets, and will need to build the library and handle displaying the objects. I've found a series of video tutorials that should help me understand the basics. Unfortunately, most documentation is difficult to find anything meaningful in, and many code examples are only substantially useful if what you need to do is very much like what the code is pre-designed to do. The broader concepts, and how to manipulate the various functions - and what the functions are in the first place - often remain difficult to find and understand. I've said it before, and nothing has changed: learning to code is a substantially difficult exercise in learning not simply how to code, but - in the first place - how to think. I have no doubt that I'll figure this process out, but it is certainly the most difficult thing I've done.<br><br>My goal for tomorrow is to take what I learn from tutorials tonight, and understand to display and change objects on the screen.

I began that project with the idea to convert a number to a string, split it into groups of 3, then evaluate those groups and length of the total list. The problem was that breaking the number into list groups left any odd number attached to the right side of the list rather than the left. I was able to invert the number, then group, and flip it back. This worked, and I thougt I had things figured out until I realized any numbers ending in zero resulted in the stripping of the zeros during the flipping process. Ultimately, I managed working code. It was bulky, but on the up side it was bulky because of all the functions I used. A significant improvement from fumbling around with functions just a week ago.<br><br>Completed our second white board challenge which invloved creating two class objects: Ant and Colony. I was rolling through it until I hit the final requirement which was to establish that a worker and a queen could reproduce. Initially, viewed this as a method of the colony because I saw it as a function of population, but ultimately once I had written the function I could see it fit as belonging to the ant class since the process creates a new ant before it creates a population increase.<br><br>Ended the day with an assignment to create or own version of the game Lemonade Stand.

I couldn't get the function to continually evaluate a new input after the first iteration through the squaring, summing, and eval process. I spent hours yesterday trying to figure out how to take new input, and place it back into the function call to get it to re-run the analysis with the new number. I was fixated almost literally on the spatial problem of how to move my new input from the bottom of the mainFunction back to the top where it was called. In the end the simple answer was move the function down - i.e. recall the function with the new input immediately after the new input was established. This example is a good expression of one part of my primary challenge to see not just the underlying data structure of the problem, but also the interconnectedness/interactivity of the parts which go on top - i.e. the classes, functions, loops, etc. It's occurred to me that the two are very closely related. It's difficult (and maybe not fully possible) to see the entirety of the underlying structure without also being practically aware of how the pieces will interact. Not that it's necessary to know what all of the pieces are, but a solid understanding of how they work seems essential to understanding structure because the nature of those interactions will ultimately necessitate certain key features of the structure.<br><br>Also, laid out substantially the primary ideas behind my color analysis tool.

It's occurred to me that code is often more readable backwards. Even the problem solving process seems to work better in reverse - i.e. coding a function to process the ultimate solution, then a function for the process before, etc. Having realized that learning to see structure is my primary need should help me focus on how to better approach things moving forward. The analogy of a tree strikes me as particularly relevant where the tree and branches are the underlying data structure, and the fruit that would hang on the tree is the various bits of code.
